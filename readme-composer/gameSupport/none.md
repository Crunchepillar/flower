## Installing From a Released version

Select and download a release from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/flowerLoader/core/releases) that uses the coaw slug ex: flower-core-none.zip

This version is not designed to support any specific game, you will need to understand how NWjs games work and how to run scripts from within them.

Determine where it is appropriate to inject flower and add a line to reference flowerful.js as a module to the scene's html file.

Flower keeps its plugins in the folder `/flower/flower-plugins/` under your base install directory. You can copy in any plugins you wish to use into this directory and then add them to the `config.js` file to use them. You can also do the opposite if you wish to disable a plugin without deleting it from your plugins folder.
