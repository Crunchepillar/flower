## FAQ & Troubleshooting
  
- **How do I report an issue?**
  - Please visit our [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/flowerLoader/core/issues).

- **How do I uninstall flowerloader**
  - The simplest and fastest way is to run `verify game files` for the game on steam.
  - Alternatively, you may remove the line you added to `index.html` and flower will no longer be loaded.
  - Finally, either way, you may remove all the files you copied in to your base game directory or leave them, they won't be loaded or effect the game in any way anymore
  
- **How do I configure what plugins Flower loads?**
  - Simply edit the `config.js` file under your base install directory in the `flower` folder. There are comments inside this file that explain how to set flower to load plugins.
